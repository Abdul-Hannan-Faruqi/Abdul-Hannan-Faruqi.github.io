# About Me

*“Mathematics is the ancient mortals’ attempt to decipher the language of the eternal nature; computing faster than nature, a modern fantasy!”*

 I am a mathematician, an engineer, and a theoretical physics and life-science researcher. At a very young age, I came across the works of Leonardo da Vinci, that resonated deeply with my passions and motivated me for the pursuit of my ideas. I study science as a means of comprehending the world around me – understanding the functioning of the universe at the most fundamental level. Therefore, in the standard terminology, my single interest spans over a wide spectrum of knowledge.
